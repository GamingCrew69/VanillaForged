# VanillaForged
A vanilla inspired preset for the ReTerraForged world generation mod.

Usage:
When creating a world, go to the "more" tab (1.19.4+) and click on "datapacks". Now add VanillaForged.zip to the datapacks by adding it into the folder that opens when you click "open datapack folder". Activate VanillaForged by clicking on the small arrow that apears when you hover over it inside minecraft. Select the world type to be "VanillaForged" (if you are not using the optional Lang Resource pack it will be named "generator.terraforged.vanillaforged"). Done
